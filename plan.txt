masterless
    point to main node? any node? when installed
        security? can any node be added?
    what if node's IP changes
        publishing IP change?
        gossip protocol


storage?
    If serverless, will all nodes have info about all info?
        Meaning, how to handle security issues
    Low size db
        json file in FS, Sqlite
security?
    passphrase

server monitoring

initial version
    main node/agent
    if agent
        ask main node IP/port
        password/key phrase to get added
    main node
        show running ip and port
        command for agent to be connected
        generate/ask for passphrase
        how to store the passphrase? should we need to protect this?
        initial version stateless?
            then no need to run as daemon
        store all node info in memory for now
    use arg parser
    run as daemon
